The application was clasifies whether a given wine is classfied as 'good' or 'bad' based on 62 decriptors. It can support non-expert customers to select quqlity wine. It can be used as a stand-alone application or incorporated as a component of a larger platform. 

The application the application works in a looped pipeline that monitors performance of the machine learning model and retraines and updates it on the fly if a data drift is dtected. 

Data to construct machine learning model were downlowaded from Kaggle. It can be accessed under the following link:

In order to run the application it is neccessary to install the following libraries:
numpy==1.19.5
pandas==1.4.2
pycaret==2.3.10
  
they can be  installed in the virtual environment by typing in Anaconda Prompt:

$ pip install <library>==<version>

To run the application type in  Anaconda Prompt the following command:
$ python wine_classifier_mod2.py

Make sure that Anaconda Prompt points the correct location where the file is stored. 

In case of evaluating new data, they should be stored in the data folder and named "batch_no.csv".
