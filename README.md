## 1. General <a name="general"></a>
The application was designed to support choice of wine. It can help non-expert customers to select quqlity wine. It can be a part of bigger software as well as stand-alone application. Besides, the pipeline should also work in a loop that: 
creates ML model, 
eveluates the model using new batches of data
detectcts data drift
in case of the data drift retraines and updates the model

Data to construct machine learning model were downlowaded from Kaggle.

## 2. Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>

The easiest way to run the application is to use Anaconda Navigator. It can be download from: https://anaconda.org/ 

After installation of the anaconda software, create a new virtual evironment in Anaconda Navigator. Use the requirements.txt to create 
new environment by typing in Anaconda Prompt:

$ conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt

The new enrvironment comprises all necessary libraries to run the application: numpy,pandas and pycaret.
  
To activate new environmet , type in the fllowing command in Anaconda Prompt:

(base) C:\Users\saras>conda activate ASI

To run the application type in  Anaconda Prompt the following command:
(ASI) C:\Users\saras> python wine_classifier_mod2.py

Make sure that Anaconda Prompt points the correct location where the file is stored.
